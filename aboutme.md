Welcome! My name is Tyler Frazier, and I am a Lecturer of Data Science at William & Mary, where I generally practice research and teaching in the area of population and development data science.  I received my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Bonn, Germany in 2011 and my Master of City Planning from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2001. My research and teaching focus on the use of data science methods to describe, analyze, model and predict human and community scale, development patterns and processes, primarily using the programming languages python, R and java.  While the scope of my research and teaching broadly focuses on population and development data science, my primary research focus is on the human development processes of West Africa with emphasis on the Republic of Ghana.

Additionally, I have been accepted as an expert witness on land use matters in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings in both Georgia and Florida.  In 2004, I became a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP).
