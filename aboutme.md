Welcome! My name is Tyler Frazier, and I am a Lecturer of Data Science at William & Mary, where I generally practice research and teaching in the area of population and development data science.  Prior to joining William & Mary in the spring of 2015, I held academic appointments at the University of Bonn - Center for Development Research, the Santa Fe Institute, and the Technical University of Berlin - Institute for Transport System Planning and Transport Telematics. I also previously served as a visiting lecturer at the Technical University of Munich, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the University of Ghana, Legon.  My research has been supported by funding from the Volkswagen Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

<br>

I received my Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Bonn, Germany in 2011, my Master of City Planning from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2001, and my Bachelor of Arts in Architectural History from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 1999. My research and teaching focus on data use in statistical programming to describe, analyze, model and predict human and community scale, development patterns and processes. For more than ten years my primary programming language has been R, while I also have considerable experience using python.  I am conversant in German and Portuguese, and informally conversant in Twi (Ghana), French and Spanish.  While the scope of my research and teaching broadly focuses on population and development data science, my primary research focus is on the human development processes of West Africa with emphasis on the Republic of Ghana.

<br>

Additionally, I have been accepted as an expert witness on land use matters in judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings in both Georgia and Florida.  In 2004, I became a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP).
