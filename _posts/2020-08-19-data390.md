# Course Description

This course is designed to permit students with a focus in Data Science to engage in directed research after completing core coursework. Working closely with a program faculty member as an advisor, each student will conduct a substantial research project focusing on synthesis and critical analysis, to solve problems in an applied and/or academic setting, to create original material or original scholarship, and to communicate effectively with a diversity of audiences.
