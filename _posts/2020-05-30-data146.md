# Course Description

Course Description: This course will focus research design in the context of data, providing an overview of different modeling approaches, their differences, and the context(s) in which each might be most appropriate to apply. Special attention will be given to cases in which complete information is not available. Each modeling framework's disciplinary history will be considered, and the overlaps and distinctions between them discussed. Students will be expected to acquire a
strong capability to identify the most appropriate modeling strategies given a problem and problem context, as well as learn the limitations or advantages of a given approach.
